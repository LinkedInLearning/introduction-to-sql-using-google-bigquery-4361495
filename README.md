## Instructions

This repository does not have any branches. Download the entire repository and you get the exercise files in their final state.

Each folder corresponds with a movie with an exercise file. The naming convention is CHAPTER#_MOVIE#. As an example, the folder named 02_03 corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.

## Installing
1. To use these exercise files, you must have an active Google Cloud Project which has BigQuery enabled. Visit [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sandbox) to setup a free BigQuery Sandbox instance.
2. View directly on GitHub the individual `solution.sql` files within each chapter and movie folder for the relevant solutions or clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.
3. Copy and paste the code directly into the BigQuery console and run the SQL queries to see the expected results.
